# Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Diabetes Dataset

This repository contains the code for a practical assignment that focuses on data exploration and preprocessing of a diabetes dataset. The assignment aims to familiarize students with basic data preprocessing and exploration tools using Python, particularly the pandas library. It also includes concepts discussed in lectures related to descriptive statistics, data visualization, data filtering, duplicated record removal, and handling missing values.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this assignment is a modified version of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases dataset. It includes several medical variables such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, and a target variable, Outcome, which indicates whether a patient has diabetes or not.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas 1.3+
- numpy 1.20+
- sklearn 0.24+
- seaborn 0.11+
- matplotlib 3.5+
- scipy 1.9+

## Files Included
- `diabetes.csv`: Data file for the questions.
- `diabetes_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned data file for the questions.
- `Practical-01.ipynb`: Python notebook programs.
- `Practical-01.html`: Notebook in HTML showing the outputs.

## Project Structure
- **Data Exploration:** Includes tasks such as descriptive statistics, boxplots, and scatter plots to analyze the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning:** Covers removing duplicated records and handling missing values using different imputation strategies.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed (listed in Requirements).
3. Open the `Practical-01.ipynb` notebook and run each cell to execute the code.

## Conclusion
This assignment provides a hands-on approach to data exploration and preprocessing, essential steps in any data analysis or machine learning project. By completing this practical, students will gain a better understanding of how to clean and prepare datasets for further analysis.
